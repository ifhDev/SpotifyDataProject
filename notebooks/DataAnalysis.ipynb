    "  - `beat_density` (tempo-to-time signature ratio)  \n",
    "  - `mood_score` (composite of valence, energy, and tempo)  \n",
    "  - `meta_genre` (broad genre categorisation)  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Less Effective Features**:  \n",
    "  - `groove_score` (highly correlated with danceability, making it redundant)  \n",
    "  - `energy_tempo_interaction` (did not add significant predictive power)  \n",

    "### **Model Performance**\n",
    "- *Linear Regression* failed to accurately capture danceability, confirming that a purely linear approach was insufficient.\n",
    "- *Random Forest Classification* provided the best results, achieving:\n",
    "  - ~84% accuracy\n",
    "  - Strong recall (~75%), ensuring that truly danceable songs were identified.\n",
    "  - Feature importance analysis confirmed that energy, valence, and genre had the greatest influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps & Potential Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to further refine this project, possible extensions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trying XGBoost**  \n",
    "   - Random Forest performed well, but an optimised XGBoost model could provide additional improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Optimising Feature Selection**  \n",
    "   - Some features (e.g., `tempo_category`) only provided minor gains. Further feature selection could enhance model efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Expanding the Dataset**  \n",
    "   - This analysis used a static snapshot from October 2022. A time-based dataset could allow us to explore if and how danceability trends evolve over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Recommendation Function**  \n",
    "   - While this is not directly part of modelling, it would be illustrative to have the insights from this analysis/modelling demonstrated in the form of a simple recommendation algorithm that, for example, creates a list of songs that increase or decrease in a selected feature over the course of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "This project successfully demonstrated how audio features impact danceability and how machine learning models can predict danceability with high accuracy. The findings also reinforce the importance of rhythm, energy, and mood in making music danceable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest model, combined with carefully engineered features, provided a strong balance between interpretability and predictive power.\n",
